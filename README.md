# 6502-emulator

Basic 6502 C emulator I am writing to get a better understanding of a basic CPU architecture.
- For now I'm not going the be implementing decimal mode but maybe when I'm finished I'll add it.

So far I've added the following instructions:
- ADC (Add With Carry)
- AND (Logical AND)
- ASL (Arithmetic Shift Left)
- BCC (Branch if Carry Clear)
- BCS (Branch if Carry Set)
- BEQ (Branch if Equal)
- BIT (Bit Test)
- BMI (Branch if Minus)

I am writing all Unit Tests using gtest
